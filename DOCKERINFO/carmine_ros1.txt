Docker container used in the context of robotic programming courses @ Unige

https://hub.docker.com/r/carms84/noetic_ros2

The image has been developed starting from a docker image providing HTML5 VNC interface to access ROS Noetic on Ubuntu 20.04 with the LXDE desktop environment.

Run it by: docker run -it --name my_ros -p 6080:80 -p 5900:5900 carms84/noetic_ros2

You may then open a browser and type http://127.0.0.1:6080/‚Å† or use a VNC client (port 5900) to connect to the VNC server.
